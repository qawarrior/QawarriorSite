I will be talking about new development projects. Using primarally Powershell, C#, IronPython and other cool technologies. I will review movies, games, and gadgets as they catch my eye. There will be times when I just use this as a place to vent things in windows and programming windows that just drive me nuts. Over all if it has a processor and a chipset its fair game. Good Times and Get-Command
